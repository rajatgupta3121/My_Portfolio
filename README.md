# Rajat Gupta - Data Analyst & Software Developer Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Rajat! I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and machine learning. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) at Allenhouse Business School, Kanpur (2022-2025), I have gained experience in Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning techniques. My passion lies in leveraging data-driven insights to build innovative solutions and improve efficiency in a dynamic work environment.

With hands-on experience in AI chatbot development, market basket analysis, and sentiment tracking, I have worked on projects that showcase my ability to handle complex datasets and derive actionable insights. I have also gained professional experience through internships in Data Science and Data Analysis, where I honed my analytical and programming skills.

In my free time, I explore new technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and enhance my skills in AI, deep learning, and automation.
